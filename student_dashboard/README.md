# Planning

1. First Create helper functions
- [x] data fetcher (csv)
- [x] data filter: score types (multi) filter
- [x] data filter: name/student (multi) filter (possibly combine with the above)
- [x] data calculator: average scores on assignments for all score types
- [x] data sort: assignment by average grades (high-low & low-high)
- [x] data sort: students by average grades (high-low & low-high)

2. Then create Components (redux included)
- Dashboard
- Chart
- Filter options
- Sorting options
- Chart options (Bar, Line, Table)
- Single student route
- Profile card
